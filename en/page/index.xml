To be honest, I don’t really like this word as it gives a dull impression. Moreover, since I started blogging, I haven’t really introduced myself, at most just mentioning my contact information. On social networks, most people only showcase their best side and even exaggerate their qualities. Many people are also reluctant to reveal too much about themselves online, and I belong to that category.</description></item><item><title>书影音游</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-notability/en/movies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 23:22:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-notability/en/movies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>搜索</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-notability/en/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 23:22:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-notability/en/search/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gears</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-notability/en/gears/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 15:39:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-notability/en/gears/</guid><description>my gear</description></item></channel></rss>
